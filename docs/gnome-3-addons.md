Gnome 3 Setup
=============

## Workspace Grid

Install [workspace-grid](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/484/workspace-grid/).

To remove workspaces from overview, set both maximum width options in plugin settings to 0 to hide workspaces from overview and also install [hide-workspace-thumbnails](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/808/hide-workspace-thumbnails/). Combination of both seems necessary.

Then install [disable-workspace-switch-animation](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1328/disable-workspace-switch-animation) to make workspace switching instant.

Finally, to disable the workspace switcher overlay, install [disable-workspace-switcher-popup](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/959/disable-workspace-switcher-popup/).

## Install GSConnect

Add awesome android integration - [GSConnect](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1319/gsconnect/).

## Add Suspend button

Add suspend button to system tray, next to shudown button - [suspend-button](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/826/suspend-button/)

## Hide Activities button

Useless noise - [hide-activities-button](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/744/hide-activities-button/).

## Dock

Ubuntu mainline has a nice dock by default. If using another flavour of gnome 3, simply install [dash-to-dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/).

## Legacy System Tray Icons

Ubuntu has a nice legacy tray by default. Otherwise, install [topicons](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1031/topicons/) to add a legacy tray.
